# pthreadpool

This work is not mine.

pthreadpool is the work of Johan Hanssen Seferidis (2011-08-12).

Some of my programs (C++) depend on this in order to have
a thread pool.

Many thanks to him.

I have placed this package here for my convenience and for
the convenience of users of my programs.

This work and all copyrights belong to Johan Hanssen Seferidis.
